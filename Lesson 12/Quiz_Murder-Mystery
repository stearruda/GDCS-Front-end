 * Programming Quiz: Murder Mystery (3-4)
 *
 *  Solve a fictitious murder mystery.
 *
 *  In this murder mystery there are:
 *
 *  - four rooms: the ballroom, gallery, billiards room, and dining room,
 *  - four weapons: poison, a trophy, a pool stick, and a knife,
 *  - four suspects: Mr. Parkes, Ms. Van Cleve, Mrs. Sparr, and Mr. Kalehoff.
 *  
 *  We also know that each weapon corresponds to a particular room, so...
 *
 *  - the poison belongs to the ballroom,
 *  - the trophy belongs to the gallery,
 *  - the pool stick belongs to the billiards room,
 *  - and the knife belongs to the dining room.
 *  
 *  And we know that each suspect was located in a specific room at the time of the murder.
 *
 *  - Mr. Parkes was located in the dining room.
 *  - Ms. Van Cleve was located in the gallery.
 *  - Mrs. Sparr was located in the billiards room.
 *  - Mr. Kalehoff was located in the ballroom.
 *  
 *  To help solve this mystery, write a combination of conditional statements that:
 *
 *  - sets the value of weapon based on the room and
 *  - sets the value of solved to true if the value of room matches the suspect's room
 *
 *  Afterwards, print the following to the console if the mystery was solved:
 *
 *  __________ did it in the __________ with the __________!
 *
